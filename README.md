tags2uml
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruben2020/tags2uml.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ruben2020/tags2uml)    


## Overview
Command line tool to convert from a [Exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) tags file to a [UML class diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram), through [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), for all object oriented languages supported by ctags

The input file is a tags file, generated by Exuberant-ctags using `--fields==+latinK`.

The output file is a Graphviz [DOT file](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) whose name is specified through the program options, or to stdout. The DOT file should then be passed to the Graphviz `dot` program to be converted into an image file (e.g. PNG, SVG etc.).

Currently we only have this in source code. Binaries are not yet distributed. This program is written in [Go](http://golang.org/) whose build toolchain is easy to use.


## Features

Currently it has only been tested on Linux, on C++ and Java source code. Work in progress.    
But it should theoritically work on other object oriented languages supported by ctags and on other platforms supported by [Go](http://golang.org/).

* Supports C++, Java, Python, Ruby and C#
* Can build and run on any platform supported by [Go](http://golang.org/) i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac
* Whitebox (with methods and members of classes) or blackbox (just class names)
* Ability to show only public methods, only public and protected methods, all methods or no methods
* Ability to show only public members, only public and protected members, all members or no members
* Class inheritance is shown
* Relationship shown, based on the data type of members of a class (only for C++, Java and C#)
* Data type of members and return types of methods of a class (only for C++, Java and C#)


## Example of generated UML class diagram

The DOT file for this was generated using these options: `tags2uml --members=1 --infile tags --outfile guava-eventbus.dot`.

This is a whitebox UML class diagram of the [Google Guava EventBus](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained), which is set to show all members and only public methods. This was the [input tags file](doc/tags) that was used and this was the [output DOT file](doc/guava-eventbus.dot) that was generated using tags2uml.

## How to build and install?

First, install the [Go](http://golang.org/) toolchain.

Please see [these instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) on how to setup the `src`, `pkg` and `bin` directories.    
The `GOPATH` environment variable also needs to be setup according to [these instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

Then, run these commands to clone the git repository and then build the source code:    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruben2020/tags2uml.git $GOPATH/src/tags2uml
go install tags2uml
```

After doing the above, the executable binary `tags2uml` should appear in `$GOPATH/bin`.    
In order to use it directly, you could add it to `PATH` like this: `export PATH=$HOME/gopath/bin:$PATH`.


## What are the dependencies?

There are no build dependencies, but to use it, you would also need [Exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).


## How to use it?

To get more information on how to use this tool, please use `tags2uml --help`.

Basic use with default options:    
```bash
cd ~/MySourceCode
ctags --fields=+latinK -R
tags2uml --infile tags --outfile MySourceCode.dot
dot -Tpng -oMySourceCode.png MySourceCode.dot
```


## How is it licensed?

It's free open source software.

It is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).    
All DOT files generated using this tool are not subject to this license.


## Can I use it in a commercial environment without purchasing, for an unlimited time?

Yes. However, donations are welcomed.


## Are there any known limitations?

For C++, [inline assembly code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_assembler) is not supported by ctags. This mainly affects embedded software, OS and driver code.


## How can I contribute?
