tags2uml
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruben2020/tags2uml.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ruben2020/tags2uml)    


## Overview
Command line tool to convert from a [Exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) tags file to a [UML class diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram), through [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), for all object oriented languages supported by ctags

The input file is a tags file, generated by Exuberant-ctags using `--fields==+latinK`.    
The output file is a Graphviz [DOT file](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) whose name is specified through the program options, or to stdout.

Currently we only have this in source code. Binaries are not yet distributed. This program is written in [Go](http://golang.org/) whose build toolchain is easy to use.


## Features

Currently it has only been tested on Linux, on C++ and Java source code. Work in progress.    
But it should theoritically work on other object oriented languages supported by ctags and on other platforms supported by [Go](http://golang.org/).

* Supports C++, Java, Python, Ruby and C#
* Can build and run on any platform supported by [Go](http://golang.org/) i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac
* Whitebox (with methods and members of classes) or blackbox (just class names)
* Ability to show only public methods, all methods or no methods
* Ability to show only public members, all methods or no members
* Class inheritance is shown
* Relationship shown, based on the data type of members of a class (only for C++, Java and C#)
* Data type of members and return types of methods of a class (only for C++, Java and C#)


## How to build and install?

<<<<<<< HEAD
First, install the [Go](http://golang.org/) toolchain.

>>>>>>> 7900e0fa78146468c33047a9f2688b48480652f1

Please see [these instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) on how to setup the `src`, `pkg` and `bin` directories.    
The `GOPATH` environment variable also needs to be setup according to [these instructions](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

Then, run these commands to clone the git repository and then build the source code:    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruben2020/tags2uml.git $GOPATH/src/tags2uml
go install tags2uml
```

After doing the above, the executable binary `tags2uml` should appear in `$GOPATH/bin`.    
<<<<<<< HEAD
In order to use it directly, you could add it to `PATH` like this: `export PATH=$HOME/gopath/bin:$PATH`.

## What are the dependencies?

<<<<<<< HEAD
There are no build dependencies, but to use it, you would also need [Exuberant-ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

## How to use it?

To get more information on how to use this tool, please use `tags2uml --help`.

Basic use with default options:    
```bash
cd ~/MySourceCode
ctags --fields=+latinK -R
tags2uml --infile tags --outfile MySourceCode.dot
dot -Tpng -oMySourceCode.png MySourceCode.dot
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Instead of `dot`, you can also try `neato` or `twopi` which will generate diagrams with different kinds of layouts.    
All of these have the same command line arguments.
